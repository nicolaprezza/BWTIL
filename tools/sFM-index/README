Welcome to the succinct FM-index data structure!

*** Brief introduction: ***

This is a version of the popular alphabet-friendly FM index, but without compression. The index occupies space close to the uncompressed text (succinct space).

*** Compile ***

In the sFM-index/ directory, just execute

> make clean; make

The executable "sFM-index" will be created in the BWTIL/ main folder.

*** Test ***

In the sFM-index/ directory, execute

> make example-build

to build a succinct FM-index with pattern on the file BWTIL/data/plain/dna.1MB . This will create the file BWTIL/data/plain/dna.1MB.sfm . After that, execute

> make example-search

to search the pattern "ATCCATGTAGATATAACACAGCTATTTTCA" (exact search) in the inex just created.

*** Notes ***

please note that, due to the particular suffix array library employed, the builtin construction of the BWT can currently handle only texts shorter than 2^31 characters. We are working to integrate more powerful BWT-construction libraries in our software.
